DevOps Class Revision Notes
---------------------------

Overview of DevOps:
-------------------
    What is DevOps?

        -> A set of practices, cultural philosophies, and tools that integrate software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).

        -> Goal: Deliver applications and services more rapidly and reliably.

    Challenges in DevOps

        -> The cultural philosophies and change management are particularly challenging.

        -> Requires convincing teams to adopt new methodologies over long-established processes.

    Key Concepts

        -> DevOps Philosophy: Applying principles to unify Dev and Ops.

        -> Shift Left Approach: Emphasizes integrating testing and quality checks earlier in the development process.

Security Testing in DevOps:
---------------------------

    Types of Security Testing

        -> SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Analyzes code for vulnerabilities without executing it.

        -> DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing): Analyzes the application in a running state to find vulnerabilities.

        -> SCA (Software Composition Analysis): Checks for vulnerabilities in open-source and third-party components/libraries.

    Code Vulnerability Example

        -> SQL Injection Attack is a common vulnerability.

        -> Mitigation: Using PreparedStatement in Java to safely escape input parameters (instead of Statement).

CI/CD Process:
--------------

    Continuous Integration (CI) Process

        The core steps to ensure code integrity:

        -> Code Checkout (download latest from repository).

        -> Dependency Management (installing necessary components).

        -> Linting (ensuring code quality/maintainability).

        -> Building (compiling and packaging).

        -> Testing (running unit tests).

        -> Security Checks (running SCA and SAST tools).

        -> Artifact Creation (generating deployable units like Docker images).

        -> Deployment to a staging environment.

    Continuous Deployment (CD) Process

        -> Automates the deployment process after CI passes.

        -> Manual intervention is only needed for predetermined issues or thresholds.

        -> Goal: Achieve a smooth, automated deployment pipeline.

Communication & Coordination:
-----------------------------

API Gateway and Microservices

    -> API Gateway: Routes requests to appropriate microservices and handles tasks like authorization and throttling.

    -> Inter-Service Communication: Microservices communicate synchronously (real-time, blocking) or asynchronously (non-blocking, often using message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka)
