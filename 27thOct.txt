Microservices and DevOps: Core Concepts
---------------------------------------

Introduction to Microservices :
-------------------------------
    What are Microservices? :

        -> Architectural style where an application is a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services.

        -> Each service uses a lightweight protocol.

        -> Contrast with monolithic architecture (single unit) by being smaller and autonomously deployable.
    
    Benefits of Microservices :

        -> Scalability: Components can be scaled independently and efficiently.

        -> Flexibility in Technology Stack: Different services can use different languages/frameworks (best tool for the job).

        -> Independent Deployment: Facilitates quicker releases.
    
    Key Concepts in Microservices:

        -> REST API Communication: Services interact via REST APIs (using HTTP/HTTPS), ensuring language independence.

        -> Statelessness: Services don't store state themselves; they rely on data stores. This allows for easy reproduction and scaling.

        -> Externalized Logging: Essential for tracing system events/failures. Tools: Fluentd, ELK Stack, Splunk for aggregation/search.

        -> Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across servers to prevent overwhelming and enhance stability/availability.

        -> DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names into IP addresses (easier for humans to remember).

DevOps Introduction :
---------------------
    Importance of DevOps:

        -> Integrates Dev (Software Development) and Ops (IT Operations).

        -> Goal: Shorten the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality.

    Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

        -> CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically testing and integrating new code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day.

        -> CD (Continuous Deployment): Automates deployment of code changes to a production environment.

        -> Emphasis on a complete CI/CD pipeline (tools and examples were suggested).
