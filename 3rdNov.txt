🐚 Introduction to Shell Scripting
---------------------------------------

Shell Basics:
-------------------------------
    Core Function:
            -> Shell scripting is an essential skill for automating tasks in **UNIX** and **Linux** environments.
            -> Shell scripts are simple programs executed by the **shell**, a command-line interpreter.

Script Creation and Execution:
-------------------------------------
    Creating a Script:
            -> File Extension: Start by creating a new file with a **.sh** extension, e.g., `hello_world.sh`.
            -> Shebang: Begin the script with **#!** followed by the path to an interpreter, usually **#!/bin/bash**.
            -> Content: The script can include various shell commands and syntax for automation.

    Script Execution:
            -> Make Executable: Use **chmod +x filename.sh** to make the script executable.
            -> Run: Run the script by typing **./filename.sh**.

Variables and Data:
-----------------------------
    Variable Usage:
            -> Define: Use **variable_name=value**. By convention, **uppercase** is used, e.g., `USERNAME="JohnDoe"`.
            -> Access: Access variables with the **$VARIABLE_NAME** syntax.
            -> Input: Input can be read using the **read -p "Prompt: " VARIABLE** command.

Conditionals and Loops:
--------------------------------
    Control Flow:
            -> Conditionals (if): Used for conditional execution. Use **[ condition ]** to evaluate conditions.
            -> File Check: Use **-f <file>** to check if a file exists within an if statement.
            -> Loops: **for** and **while** are used to iterate over sequences or conditions.

🔒 File Permissions and Management
------------------------------------------

File and Directory Management:
-------------------------------------
    Basic Operations:
            -> Create/Navigate: Use **mkdir** to create directories and **cd** to navigate them.
            -> Create Files: Use **touch** or **cat > filename** to create files.

    Common Commands:
            -> Essentials: **ls**, **pwd**, **cd**, **rm**, **cp**, **mv** are basic but essential commands.
            -> Caution: Commands such as **rm -rf** are used cautiously as they remove directories recursively and forcefully.

File Permissions:
-------------------------
    Permissions Control:
            -> Modification: Permissions for **users**, **groups**, and **others** are crucial and can be modified using **chmod**.
            -> Notations: Permission notations include **rwx** which stand for **read**, **write**, and **execute** permissions.
            -> Advanced: **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** allow for more granular permission settings compared to the traditional chmod.

🔍 String Manipulation and Utilities
--------------------------------------------

String Manipulation:
---------------------------
    Text Transformation:
            -> Tools: Use commands like **tr**, **sed**, and **awk** for transforming text.
            -> Example (Uppercasing): Can be achieved with **echo $STRING | tr [a-z] [A-Z]**.

Find and Locate Commands:
----------------------------------
    Search Utility:
            -> The **find** command: Powerful for searching files based on patterns, types, and other attributes.
            -> Syntax: **find <path> -name <pattern>**.

Regular Expressions (Regex):
------------------------------------
    Text Processing:
            -> Importance: Regular expressions are vital for text processing within the shell, though not covered extensively in the class.

🚀 Advanced Scripting Concepts
---------------------------------------

Function Definition and Usage:
------------------------------------
    Code Reusability:
            -> Definition: Functions encapsulate reusable code blocks.
            -> Syntax:
my_function() {
    commands
}
            -> Call: Call functions by their name, **my_function**.

User and Group Management:
----------------------------------
    Administration Automation:
            -> Commands: Shell scripts can automate the creation of users and groups using **useradd** and **groupadd**.
            -> Tasks: This involves setting default shells, welcome messages, and permissions.
